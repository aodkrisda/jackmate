Instructions:

1. Open Terminal

2. Download and install CMake and other required dependencies:

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libgtk2.0-dev libtiff4-dev libjasper-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libavcodec-dev libjpeg62-dev

3. Download OpenCV 2.2.0 (choose a folder where you wish to download the file to: e.g. home/Downloads):

$ cd Downloads
$ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix/2.3/OpenCV-2.2.0.tar.bz2

4. Unpack archive and navigate to the newly created folder containing the OpenCV source:

$ tar -xvf OpenCV-2.2.0.tar.bz2
$ cd OpenCV-2.2.0/

5. Create a new folder and navigate to it (the build files generated by CMake will go into this folder):

$ mkdir release 
$ cd release

6. Use CMake to generate the makefile:

Note: Remember to specify the source folder as the last argument while invoking cmake.

$ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..

7. Compile and install OpenCV:

$ sudo make install

8. Point system to generated libraries (change path if different):

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/Downloads/OpenCV-2.2.0/release/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ sudo ldconfig

9. (Optional) Use pkg-config to simplify the "making/building" of your OpenCV projects:

$ pkg-config opencv --libs

OpenCV dependencies can now be linked with simply: `pkg-config opencv --cflags --libs`

10. Restart Ubuntu to complete installation.
2.2 Installing Qt

Note: Steps 4 and 5 explain how to configure Qt Creator for use with the OpenCV libraries.

1. Download the latest version of the Qt SDK for Linux/X11 from the Nokia Qt website: http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/

2. Follow the installation instructions on the download page.

$ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..

7. Compile and install OpenCV:
we added an executable file called JackMate, it should work fine.
however if there are any problems with the file follow the next steps to run the program from code
