JackMate is a computer-vision project for the computer-vision workshop in TAU 2011.
JackMate is a prototype for a real-time high-response program meant to analyse a black-jack game and advise accordingly.

written mostly in C, partly in (broken) C++ for the business logic, and Qt for the front-end (3rd side code used).
